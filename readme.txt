This plugin allows you to put two images next to each other. When you move your mouse over them, the line that separates them will move with it!

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to put two images next to each other. When you move your mouse over them, the line that separates them will move with it! It's perfect to compare "before" and "now" images.

This plugin will use jQuery to detect when your mouse gets into the box and move the white bar with it.

Simply use the shortcodes like this:
`[sidebyside]
  [sidebyside-left]
    Put here whatever content you want to be on the left side
  [/sidebyside-left]

  [sidebyside-right]
    This is the place for the content that goes to the right
  [/sidebyside-right]
[/sidebyside]`

= What should I put in the shortcodes? =
You can put whatever you want.

My suggestion is that you put two images with the same height

Yes!

All CSS properties are written with responsive design in mind. So it will look good in all kind of screen sizes.
